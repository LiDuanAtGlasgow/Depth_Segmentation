# Depth_Segmentation
This is Li Duan's project 'KCNet-GarNet: a data-centric approach for dual-armed robotic garment flattening'

Depth Segmentation is a key technique in this project, where we have to segment garments from backgrouds. We apply a depth information based technique to find specific distance ranges for garments, which has been proved to be effective.
